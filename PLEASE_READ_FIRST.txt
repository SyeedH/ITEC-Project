Submission Notes:
-Radio buttons were unlinked as I was playing with them for fun and they kept trying to send
data...which crashes the page obviously. The intended behavior is you add the product from the main page, get sent to your cart 
where you can select package options and then proceed to final checkout. There WAS going to be a product quantity as well, but it didn't
look as I'd hoped so I took it back out.
-My partner had far too much time.... there are more revisions for the logo than I made for my gender and the law final essay last year.
